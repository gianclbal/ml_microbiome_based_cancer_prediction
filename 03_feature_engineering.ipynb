    "# **Experiment 2: Feature Engineering**\n",
    "\n",
    "## ***Objectives for this Notebook***\n",
    "* Showcase feature engineering, dimensionality reduction techniques, Pipeline, and different ways to evaluate your models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning models thrive on good data. But raw data often comes messy and unrefined, holding hidden gems amidst irrelevant clutter. This is where feature engineering comes in to offer valuable insights and enhance our datasets for better model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feature Engineering** is the process of transforming raw data into features that are suitable for training and deploying machine learning models. Simply, it's about:\n",
    "* Selecting the right features: Choosing the most relevant features that hold predictive power for your target variable. Think carefully, irrelevant features can mislead your model!\n",
    "* Transforming features: Scaling, normalizing, or encoding categorical data to ensure all features play fair in the model's eyes. No one wants features dominating the competition due to unfair advantages!\n",
    "* **Creating new features: Combining existing features or extracting hidden patterns to unlock deeper insights. New features can be like secret weapons for your model!**\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, we are going to focus on creating new features using algorithms that are also used for another technique called dimensionality reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dimensionality reduction** is a technique used in machine learning to reduce the number of features in a dataset while preserving its essential information. The goal is to simplify the data and improve computational efficiency, mitigate the curse of dimensionality, and enhance the performance of machine learning models. Because we're not really working with a large dataset, we don't need to implement dimensionality reduction in this notebook. But it's important to know that our gameplan for creating new features is to use dimensionality reduction techniques such as NMF, LDA, and PCA, to extract latent features, and then appending those latent features to our current feature space. The process of capturing of new features is also called **feature extraction**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithms**:\n",
    "* *Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)*: NMF is a factorization technique that decomposes a matrix into two non-negative matrices. It is particularly useful for non-negative data, such as images or text, and is often applied in topic modeling and image processing.\n",
    "* *Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)*: LDA is a probabilistic generative model used for topic modeling. It assumes that documents are mixtures of topics and that each word's presence is attributable to one of the document's topics. LDA helps discover the underlying topics in a collection of documents.\n",
    "* *Principal Componentn Analysis (PCA)* finds the simplest \"directions\" in your data that capture the most variation, letting you see the big picture with fewer dimensions.\n"

    "To recap, here's what we've done so far. We've done feature engineering using GridSearch that gave us new augmented datasets. With these augmented datasets, we can now train them. The code below is the same training loop function we have in experiment 1, except that the hyperpameter grids are now created using the create_hyperparameter_grids function, and we added a confusion matrix that tells us what type of errors the models is making.\n",

    "The evaluation portion of the model is incporated in the training function. You can modify the metric you want to use to evaluate the performance of your model by changing the `scoring` argument. We chose \"balanced_accuracy\" because it is the metric that the paper used.\n",
