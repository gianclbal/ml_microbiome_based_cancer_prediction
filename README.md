# Machine learning-based approaches in cancer prediction using microbiome data

## Overview

The objective of this project is to showcase what are some of the new machine learning techniques that you will learn from CSC 9008. It is an example of what a complete machine learning project in biology could look like. This series is built around the paper ["Machine learning-based approaches for cancer prediction using microbiome data"](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-38670-0) by Pedro Freitas, et al. The paper explores the association of microbiome composition and cancer type. It answers the question, "Can we use machine learning to predict cancer type using microbiome data?"
